                <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
                <li>Whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon stick)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon biryani masala</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
                <li>Water as needed</li>
                <li>Saffron strands soaked in milk (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
                <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pot. Add whole spices and sauté for a minute.</li>
                <li>Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biryani masala. Cook until the oil separates from the mixture.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken or vegetables, and cook until they are partially cooked through.</li>
                <li>Mix in yogurt, coriander leaves, and mint leaves. Cook for a few more minutes until the meat or vegetables are fully cooked.</li>
                <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and the soaked, drained rice. Cook the rice until it's 70% cooked. Drain the rice.</li>
                <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked meat or vegetables in the pot. If using saffron, drizzle it over the top.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or foil. Cook on low heat for 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
                <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Enjoy hot with raita and salad.</li>
