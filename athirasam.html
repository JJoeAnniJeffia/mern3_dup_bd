            <h2>About Athirasam</h2>
            <p>Athirasam is a cherished delicacy in South Indian cuisine, particularly popular in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The name "Athirasam" translates to “sweet rice cake” in Tamil. It is a part of traditional festive sweets and is often made during celebrations such as Diwali and Pongal.

                <li>1 cup jaggery</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>

                <li>Soak the rice in water for 2 hours. Drain and grind the rice to a fine paste with a little water.</li>
                <li>In a pan, heat the water and add jaggery. Stir until the jaggery dissolves completely and forms a thick syrup.</li>
                <li>Add the rice paste to the jaggery syrup and cook on low heat, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.</li>
                <li>Mix in cardamom powder and sesame seeds if using. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Once cool enough to handle, shape the mixture into small discs or rings using your hands or a mold.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a pan for deep frying. Fry the discs in hot oil until golden brown and crisp on both sides.</li>
                <li>Remove the Athirasam from the oil and drain on paper towels. Allow to cool completely before serving.</li>
